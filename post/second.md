Speakin' of the devil psych, no it's the God, get the **** right<br>
Mega trife, and yo I killed you in a past life<br>
On the mic while you was kickin' that fast ****<br>
You reneged tried again, and got blasted<br>
Half mastered ass style mad ruff task<br>
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask<br>
Remember that ****? I know you don't remember Jack<br>
That night yo I was hittin' like a spiked bat<br><br>
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy<br>
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy<br>
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs<br>
Never shot thugs, I'm runnin' with thugs that flood mugs<br>
So grab your eight plus one, start flippin' and trippin'<br>
*****z is jettin' I'm lickin' off son<br>
