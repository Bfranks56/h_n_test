Here I go, deep type flow<br>
Jacquie Cousteau could never get this low, I'm<br>
Cherry bombin' ****s boom<br>
Just warmin' up a little bit, vroom vroom<br>
Rappinin' is what's happenin'<br>
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clappin' and<br>
At the party when I move my body<br>
Gotta get up, and be somebody<br><br>
Grab the microphone put strength to the bone<br>
Duh-duh-duh enter the Wu-Tang zone<br>
Sure enough when I rock that stuff<br>
Guff puff I'm gonna catch your bluff tuff<br>
Rough, kickin' rhymes like Jim Kelly<br>
Or Alex Haley I'm a Mi Beetle Bailey rhymes<br>
Comin' raw style, hardcore<br>
*****z be comin' to the hip-hop store<br><br>
Comin' to buy gro-cery from me<br>
Tryin' to be a hip-hop MC<br>
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang<br>
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang<br>
Represent the GZA, Abbott, RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck<br>
Dirty Hoe gettin' low wit his flow<br>
Introducing, the Ghost face Killah<br>
No one could get illa<br>
