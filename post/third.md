Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty<br>
What justifies the homicide, when he dies?<br>
In his own iniquity it's the<br>
Master of the Mantis Rapture comin' at cha<br>
We have an APB on an MC Killer<br>
Looks like the work of a Master<br>
Evidence indicates that's it's stature<br>
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture<br><br>
The flow, changes like a chameleon<br>
Plays like a friend, and stabs you like a dagger<br>
This technique attacks the immune system<br>
Disguised like a lie paralyzin' the victim<br>
You scream, as it enters your bloodstream<br>
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain<br>
Novin' on a ***** with the speed of a centipede<br>
And injure any mother****ing contender<br>
